# README

A small project consisting of just vanilla HTML/CSS/JavaScript. No libraries, no frameworks, this is as simple as it can get.

## Functionality

This is a simple dice roller, for when you don't have any dice with you, or when that one spell requires rolling more dice than you have available. You specify how many faces the die you want to roll has, how many instances of that die you want to roll and any modifier you may want to add.

For exemple, if your 5th edition DnD wizard wants to cast Scorching Ray, first they'll have to make an attack roll, which would be **one instance** of a **20-sided die** with a modifier of **their intelligence modifier + their proficiency bonus**.
If the spell hits, then the damage roll would be **two instances** of a **six-sided die** with no modifier.

*You can use it as much as you want, but do give credit if you use the source code!*
